                    CGI is more cost effective than live-action, because CGI does not require a lot of resources such as crew members, actors, shooting locations, props and costume etc. With the help of CGI, you can create all these characters and objects and create high quality 2D & 3D animations.

                VFX is better due to its ability to allow integration in live action footage, practical effects and virtual enhancements, In production environments CGI is not flexible to make changes as it costs more and is highly time consuming.

                    VFX contains different techniques that integrate with acted scenes and footage, and it similarly has the ability to implement all that on CGI elements.
